## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Kite Battle
- **Category**: gaming

### Description
Kite Battle is a simple yet fun game inspired by traditional kite fighting. Players launch virtual kites, try to cut their opponentsâ€™ kite strings, and aim to be the last kite flying. The vApp brings nostalgic real-world gameplay into a decentralized environment where results are transparent and verifiable on-chain.

### SL Integration  
Kite Battle uses Soundness Layer for:

Verifying kite battles through on-chain randomness and fairness.
Recording match results and leaderboard scores on the blockchain.
Enabling players to create or join matches securely without a centralized server.

## Technical

### Architecture
Player actions (attack/defend) are signed and sent to SL smart contracts.
SL handles randomness (e.g., wind effects) and battle outcome logic.
Game state and match history are stored on-chain.
A lightweight frontend connects to SL and displays the game UI.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js (for API helpers, if needed)  
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (main logic and state)
- **Storage**: On-chain storage via SL, WALRUS/IPFS for static assets (optional)

### Features
1. Create or join a kite battle room.
2. On-chain battle logic with randomness (wind + attack/defense).  
3. Leaderboard showing top players and their win streaks.

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Basic functionality (kite launching + cutting mechanic)
- [ ] SL integration for match result verification
- [ ] Simple web UI with battle animation

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Full battle features (attack, defense, randomness)
- [ ] Production-ready deployment on SL testnet
- [ ] Leaderboard and user testing with community

## Innovation
Kite Battle is unique because it combines cultural nostalgia with decentralized gaming. Instead of a centralized server deciding outcomes, every battle is validated on-chain, ensuring fairness and transparency. The lightweight mechanics make it easy for anyone to try, while still showcasing how games can run trustlessly on the Soundness Layer.
